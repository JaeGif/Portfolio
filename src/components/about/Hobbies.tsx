        Outside of full stack development, I dabble in hobbies that help fuel my
        creativity. I take and edit photos with a Canon T6 Rebel, Photoshop and
        Lightroom. I fly a DJI Mavic Mini 2 drone for some interesting shots and
        angles, and I rock climb, solving interesting problems. I surf and get
        totally rolled. Here&apos;s a selection of some interesting photos
        I&apos;ve taken recently.
